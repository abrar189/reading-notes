# How Computers Work

## we know that the computers are changing the world.we can see them everywhere but we did not ask ourselves how it works ?

## The pioneers of Computer science explord how to design a thinking machine thye realized that it had to perfome four tasks , take input store information process it and then output the results.
##  in the 20th century, computers started using electrical componants Where it was large and slow.
- first input : You can tell the computer what you want via the keyboard , the mouse , the microphone and the camera .
- storage and processing : All of these inputs and information are stored in the computer's memory ,a computer processor tasks information from memory it's changes is using an algorithm (serise of commands ) thin it sends the processed information again to memory this continues until the information is ready to be output.
