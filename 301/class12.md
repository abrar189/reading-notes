# nosql vs sql

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

|  SQL	 | NoSQL  |
|---|---|
|called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)|called as non-relational or distributed database.|
|table based databases|document based|
|have predefined schema |have dynamic schema for unstructured data|
|vertically scalable|horizontally scalable|
|scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware|scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources|

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

3. Give a real world example.

- MySQL Community Edition
- Oracle Express Edition

4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

- Nosql database selection criteria
- Choose NoSQL if you have or need:
- Semi-structured or Unstructured data / * flexible schema.
- Limited pre-defined access paths and query patterns.
- No complex queries, stored procedures, or views.
- High velocity transactions

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry.

6. What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language
SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems.

7. Which type of database is best for scalability SQL vs NoSQL SQL databases are vertically scalable, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, NoSQL are better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

9. What is a realational database? A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

10. What type of structure does a relational database work with? The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure.

11. What is a ‘schema’? You may want to hide the complexities of the underlying database schema, or even customize the data and schema for a particular set of users. Sometimes, you may wish to control access to rows and columns of data. Other times, you may just want to aggregate data for performance reasons.

relational databases and non-relational databases. The difference speaks to how they’re built, the type of information they store, and how they store it. Relational databases are structured, like phone books that store phone numbers and addresses. Non-relational databases are document-oriented and distributed, like file folders that hold everything from a person’s address and phone number to their Facebook likes and online shopping preferences.

12. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions

13. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? Disadvantages. NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability.
