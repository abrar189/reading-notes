# An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

1. What is node.js?

There are plenty of definitions to be found online. Let’s take a look at a couple of the more popular ones. This is what the project’s home page has to say:
Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

And this is what Stack Overflow has to offer:
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
library bild in inside the terminal .

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node.js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return

4. What is npm?
node package manager The letters npm stand for “node package manager”. When you are working on a JavaScript project, you can use npm to install other people's code packages into your own project.

5. What version of node are you running on your machine? v12.22.1

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine? 7.18.1

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
npm install jshint

8. What is node used for?

Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

- Greater efficiency. It is a common misconception * that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. 
- Engaged collaboration. 
- Learning from fellow students. 
- Social skills. 
- Job interview readiness. 
- Work environment readiness.

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
Greater efficiency

3. How does pair programming work?

 While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
