# Lists

- Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
- Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
- Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

## Nested Lists
You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.

# Summary BOXES

1. CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
2. You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
3. You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
4. It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
5. Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
6. Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
7. CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

# Javascript ARRAYS 
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

## DECISIONS
Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down.
## LOOPS
There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly. 

# summary:

- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
