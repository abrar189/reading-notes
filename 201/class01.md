# Structure

1. HTML pages are text documents.
2. HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
3. Tags are often referred to as elements.
4. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes  the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
5. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
6. Attributes require a name and a value.
7. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

# EXTRA MARKUP
1. DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
2. You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
3. The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
4. The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
5. <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
6. The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
7. Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

# HTML5 LAYOUT
1. The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
2. The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
3. Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
4. To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

# THE ABC OF PROGRAMMING
 1. script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
2. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 
3. Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 
4. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
