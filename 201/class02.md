##  Headings and paragraphs

1. HTML has six "levels" of headings:

2. To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag.

## Bold, italic
1. By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.

2. By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.

## Superscript & Subscrip

1. The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power .

2. The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas

## CSS
**CSS** allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

# summary :

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

## WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. 

A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs.
