### What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?

It can be hard to imagine that many of the applications and programs we use today are built by hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people all over the world. Open-source software (OSS) is a rapidly growing industry that provides many benefits to the individuals and businesses who use it, as well as to its programmers.

here are some of the most common reasons why developers contribute to open-source software:

1. Improve Coding Skills:  For developers, contributing to OSS means that they not only practice their programming skills, but that they also learn and gain feedback from more accomplished programmers. This jumping-in-the-deep-end style of learning provides aspiring programmers with real-life, first-hand experience and greatly accelerates their learning curve.

2. Gain Early Experience:  Contributing to OSS allows developers to become better at reading code produced by others, finding and fixing bugs, and adding their code into the main repository. These are all activities developers experience working in a tech company.

3. Increase Community and Peer Recognition:  Many developers are extremely determined to become the best developer they can be to meet certain personal goals, and having your code accepted by a big OSS project is a considered a massive achievement.

4. Greater Job Prospects:  In the same way contributing to OSS can help you increase your chances of landing an internship, it can also improve your job and career prospects.

5. Improve Software on a User and Business Level.
