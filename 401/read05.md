# Linked List

## Add a node after a given value in these steps:

If you want to add a node after a given value, follow these steps:

- add a current node that points at the current node and assign it to the head.
- create a new node for the value
- then by using while loop and current.next loop through the linked list
- create a condition to check if the current node is equal to the value
- first add a reference for the new node to the current node.next
- then change the reference for the current node to the new node

## Big O

Big O Notation is a method of evaluating an algorithm's performance . It's a means of expressing how long a function, operation, or algorithm takes to perform based on the number of elements we provide to it . An O(1) function runs in constant time, which means that no matter how huge our input is, our algorithm will always require the same amount of time and memory to run.

- time: O(n) (worse case) the node which has the value that searches for it is last

- space: O(1) This because there is no additional space being used

## Memory management

- The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines.

- When an array is created , it needs a certain amount of memory(all in one place ). On the other hand, when a linked list is born, it doesnâ€™t need bytes of memory all in one place. One byte could live somewhere, while the next byte could be stored in another place in memory altogether!
