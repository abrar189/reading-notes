*GIT*
**what is Git?**

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

**History of Git ?**

Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel. Developers of this project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002
