**Html5 elements **

many of the <div> elements have been replaced by new HTML5 layoute lements. For example, the header sits inside a new <header> element, the navigation in a <nav> element, and the articles are in individual <article> elements. The point of creating these new elements is so that web page authors can use them to help describe the structure of the page. For example, screen reader software might allow users to ignore headers and footers and get straight to the content. Similarly, search engines might place more weight on the content in an <article> element than that in the <header> or <footer> elements.

**Html5 layoute:**

1. The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
2.  The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
3.  Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
4. To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google
