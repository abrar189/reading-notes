# Images
## Adding Images
< img > 
To add an image into the page you need to use an < img > element. This is an empty
element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

- src :This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called images â€” relative URLs

- alt: This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

- title:  You can also use the title attribute with the < img > element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.

**height This specifies the height of the image in pixels.**
**width This specifies the width of the image in pixels.**

## Where to Place Images in Your Code
1. Before a paragraph
2. Inside the start of a paragraph
3. In the middle of a paragraph

# Color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
 - rgb values: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)

 - Hex codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80

- color names: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan.

## Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
