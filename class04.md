# Links 
links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing. Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
