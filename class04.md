# Links 
links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing. Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Linking to Other Sites

- <a> chapter-04/linking-to-other-sites.html HTML Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.

## Email Links
- mailto: chapter-04/email-links.html HTML To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.

## Opening Links in a New Window
- target If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.

# Layout
Building Blocks CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

- Block-level elements start on a new line Examples include: <h1> <p> <ul> <li>
- Inline elements flow in between surrounding text Examples include: <img> <b> <i>.


## Summary LAYOUT

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
          
# FUNCTIONS & OBJECTS 

## functions :
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
